# Sahaaya - Making web accessible for everyone

## What it does
Sahaaya is browser extension that changes the appearence of the entire web based on your design customizations and preferences. Itâ€™s especially helpful for people with dyslexia, because it comes built-in with an option that adjusts the color-contrast ratio and typography. We provide a huge variety of color contrast schemes with different font styles so that every user can adapt to his/her preferences.

## How I built it
I build this app using chrome APIs to manipulate web pages to change their color contrast and typography according to the preferences

## Challenges I ran into
The greatest challanges I faced in this project to manipulate DOM of external websites that too using a chrome extension

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I was able to make this project in such a short time(4 days) and I am really proud of what I have accomplished in such a short time

## What I learned
I really mastered DOM manipulation after using it so extensively in this project and got a really in depth understanding of how Chrome extensions and APIs work

## What's next for Sahaaya - Making web accessible to everyone
I want to add Text to speech feature in this extension to also include auditory challenged people
